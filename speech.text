To be honest, this rotation wasn’t always easy—but that’s exactly why it was valuable.
Co-leading a project with tight timelines, parallel workstreams, and multiple teams involved pushed me to get more structured, more assertive, and more thoughtful in how I communicate.
It also showed me that things don’t always go to plan—and that’s okay, as long as you know how to adjust and keep everyone aligned.
I might not enjoy the chaos, but I’ve definitely learned how to navigate it—and that’s something I’ll carry forward into whatever comes next.
Thanks for listening.



In projects like this, project management isn’t just helpful—it’s necessary.
We’re using Agile methodology, which means sprints, backlog prioritization, regular check-ins, and constant realignment.
My focus is to make sure that dependencies are clear, blockers are raised early, and that people aren’t working in silos.
I’ve learned that good project management is less about controlling tasks and more about creating clarity. If everyone understands what’s next and why, things move a lot smoother.



Slide 1 – Introduction

“Hi, good morning everyone. My name is Mariana Castro, and this is my second ASPIRE pitchout, where I’ll be sharing my current rotation experience within DT Finance, specifically supporting a Finance Systems Transformation initiative.”

Slide 2 – About Me

“Before diving into the project, here’s a bit about me.
I graduated in July 2023 from Tecnológico de Monterrey in Querétaro, which is also where I’m currently based.
Outside of work, I enjoy reading, cooking, and following Formula 1 and the NFL. So most weekends, you’ll find me cheering for Red Bull or the 49ers, depending on the season.”

Slide 3 – What the Project Is & Why It Matters

“The project I’ve been working on is part of a larger Finance Systems Transformation effort, focused specifically on Master Data Management—MDM.
We’re currently in Wave 2 of the project, which is all about centralizing and standardizing financial data across systems.
Before this, data like vendors or cost centers could be duplicated or inconsistent across platforms. The goal is to create a single source of truth that supports better reporting, automation, and long-term efficiency across Finance operations.”

Slide 4 – My Role: Co-Leading the Team

“In this rotation, I’ve been co-leading the upstream development team and acting as the project manager.
My job is to align business stakeholders, internal developers, and external vendors. I track progress, lead meetings, and ensure tasks are moving forward—especially since many components are being worked on in parallel under tight timelines.
We’re working with Power Platform technologies such as Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Dataverse, and custom connector integrations using Informatica 360 APIs.
I joined early during requirement gathering and will be supporting Wave 3 in a similar role—coordinating scope, follow-ups, and delivery planning.”

Slide 5 – Visual Preview: Deliverables

“Just to give a quick look at what we’ve been working on—here are a few screenshots of the actual solution.
This includes the app interface built using Power Apps, which connects to Dataverse and the Informatica API.
It enables cleaner validation and easier access to master data, reducing manual errors and streamlining the process for end users.
Being part of this process helped me better understand how strategic coordination and technical execution come together.”

Slide 6 – Handling Complexity

“This rotation involved a lot of moving pieces—tight deadlines, multiple teams, and external dependencies.
There were moments when third-party delays affected our internal progress, and I had to step in to re-prioritize, escalate when needed, and keep momentum going.
Working through that helped me become more structured, more patient, and much more intentional with how I communicate across different groups.”

Slide 7 – Rotation Takeaways

**“This rotation helped me grow a lot as a project leader.
	•	I strengthened my communication, time management, and ownership.
	•	I learned how to lead without formal authority, manage shifting priorities, and keep teams aligned across regions.
	•	I also joined the Global Communications & Branding Committee within ASPIRE, where I’ve developed visibility skills and built connections across different tracks.”**

“It wasn’t always easy—but that’s what made it valuable.
Navigating complexity, realigning people, and dealing with fast-moving workstreams helped me realize how much I can handle under pressure.
I might not love the chaos, but I’ve learned how to lead through it—and that’s something I’ll take with me moving forward.
Thank you for listening.”
