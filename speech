Hi everyone! Let me introduce you to the Advisory Committee.

Our mission is really about providing guidance and support for all ASPIREs by bringing together our collective expertise and encouraging collaboration. The idea is that by working closely with everyone, we can gather useful feedback, understand the challenges people face, and turn that into opportunities for growth and improvement.

We focus on three main areas:
First, development. We’re building an interactive tool to help ASPIREs keep track of their path—things like planning rotations, monitoring competencies, and also handling the feedback forms that are part of the program.
Second, SharePoint pages review. We regularly check the E&T ASPIRE committees’ SharePoint pages and also manage the main page, so that information is always accurate and easy to find.
And third, collaboration. We work as a bridge between the E&T ASPIRE committees and also serve as the entry point for new activities, making sure everything stays connected and aligned.

So overall, the Advisory Committee is about listening, connecting, and helping the Aspire journey move forward.”
